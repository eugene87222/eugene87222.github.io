# The Need to Justify Our Actions: The Costs and Benefits of Dissonance Reduction

---

# What is cognitive dissonance, and how do people avoid dissonance to maintain a positive self-image ?

- When confronted with unfavorable view of self
    - Experience discomfort

## When cognitions conflict

- Cognitive dissonance
    - Discomfort that people feel when __two cognitions (beliefs,attitudes) conflict__, or when they __behave in ways that are inconsistent with their conception of themselves__
- Important and provocative social psychological theory
- Threats to self-image
    - Induces powerful, upsetting dissonance

## 4 ways to reduce dissonance

- Change behavior
- Justify behavior by changing one of the dissonance cognitions
- Justify behavior by adding new cognitions

## Self-affirmation 自我肯定

- Bolster(支撐) the self-concept
- Reducing dissonance by adding a cognition about other positive attributes

## Impact bias 衝擊偏誤

- The tendency to __overestimate the intensity and duration of our emotional reactions to future negative events__

## Why we overestimate the pain of disappointment

- Why does impact bias occur ?
    - __Process of reducing dissonance is largely unconscious__

## Dissonance and the self-concept

- Dissonance most painful when one of the cognitions is about the self
    - __Particularly true for those with high self-esteem__
- Temporary blows to self-esteem can lead to greater behaviors consistent with low opinion of the self (e.g., cheat)
- People less likely to cheat when their self-concept of "not being a cheater" is invoked

## Decisions

- Every time we make a decision, we experience dissonance
    - Chosen alternative has some negative aspects
    - Rejected alternative has some positive aspects
    - 得不到的最好

## Distorting our likes and dislikes

- Distort likes and dislikes
    - Downplay
        - Negative aspects of chosen alternative
        - Positive aspects of rejected alternative
- Postdecision dissonance 決策後的失調

## Permanence of the decision 決策的永久性

- More important decisions = more dissonance
- Greater performance = more dissonance

## Creating the illusion of irrevocablility 製造不可反悔的錯覺

- When decisions are permanent (irrevocable)
    - Dissonance increases
    - Motivation to reduce dissonance increases
- Lowballing 低球法
    - Salesperson induces a customer to agree to purchase a product at a very low cost, subsequently claims it was an error, and then raise the price
    - Frequently, the customer will agree to make the purchase at the inflated price

## 3 reasons lowballing works

- Sense of commitment
- Sense of commitment triggers the anticipation of an exciting event
- Price only slightly higher that other prices elsewhere

## The decision to behave immorally

- Moral dilemmas
    - Implications for self-esteem
- Dissonance reduction
    - People may behave either more ethically or less ethically in the future
- Example: cheating on a test
    - Dissonance
        - Positive view of self inconsistent with dishonest behavior
    - How to reduce dissonance ?
        - Change attitude about cheating
            - "Not a big deal, everyone does it"

# How does cognitive dissonance operate in everyday life, and what are some constructive ways of reducing it ?

## The justification of effort 為付出的努力辯護

- People may interpret ambiguities in a positive way when it helps to justify effort
- The tendency for individuals to __increase their liking for something they have worked hard to attain__

## External versus internal justification

- External justification 外部理由
- Internal justification 內部理由
    - e.g. one's attitude or behavior

## Counterattitudinal advocacy 反態度主張

- Stating an opinion or attitude that tuns counter to one's private belief or attitude

## Punishment and self-persuasion

- If threat of punishment for engaging in a forbidden behavior is __severe__
    - There is sufficient external justification for refraining from behavior
- If punishment is __less severe__
    - There is insufficient external justification
    - Creates greater need for __internal justification__
        - Change attitudes via __self-persuasion__
- Insufficient punishment
- When external justification for resisting an object or activity is insufficient
    - Dissonance is aroused
    - Reduce dissonance by
        - Self-persuasion
            - e.g., devaluing forbidden activity or object

## The lasting effects of self-persuasion

- IV = severity of threatened punishment
    - 1/2 children: threat of mild punishment if they disobeyed and played with toy
    - 1/2 children: threat of severe punishment
- DV: rating of toy attractiveness
- Self-persuasion
    - A long-lasting form of attitude change that results from attempts at self-justification

## The hypocrisy paradigm 虛偽 / 偽善典範

- Induce hypocrisy 虛偽 / 偽善誘導
    - Make person aware of conflict between
        - Attitudes
        - Behavior
    - Hypocrisy creates dissonance
    - Reduce dissonance by changing behavior
        - e.g., attitudes about condoms and use of condoms
- Students in the hypocrisy condition were subsequently more likely to buy condoms than students in any of other conditions
