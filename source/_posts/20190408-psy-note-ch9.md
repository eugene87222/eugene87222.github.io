# Intelligence

# How is human intelligence defined and measured ?

- Crystallized Intelligence 結晶智力: ability to solve problems using "already acquired" knowledge
    - Measured by tests of vocabulary, arithmetic , and general information
    - Recurring, concrete challenges
- Fluid Intelligence 流體智力: ability to solve novel problems involving perceptual speed or rapid insight (ability to see complex relationships and solve problems)
    - Measured by tests of block designs and spatial visualization
    - Novel, abstract problems
- Aptitudes 性向
    - Aptitude: capacity for learning certain abilities
    - Special aptitude test: test that predicts whether you will succeed in a single area
    - Multiple aptitude test: test that measures two or more types of ability
    - General intelligence test: test that assesses a wide variety of mental abilities

# What are typical IQ tests like ?

- Reliability 信度 and validity 效度
   - Psychometric test: any measurement of a person’s mental functions
   - Reliability: a reliable psychometric test must give approximately the "same score" each time a person takes it
   - Validity: a valid psychometric test should "measure what it claims to measure"
- Objective testing
    - Objective test 客觀的測驗: a test (IQ or otherwise) is objective if it gives the same score when corrected by different people
    - Test standardization 標準化: first, it means standard procedures are used in giving the test and, second, individual test scores are compared to norms常模, or average scores made by a large group of people like those for whom the test was designed
- Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale
- SB5 five cognitive factors
    - Fluid reasoning: ability to reason in "unfamiliar situation"
    - Knowledge: knowledge about a wide range of topics
    - Quantitative reasoning: ability to solve problems "involving numbers"
    - Visual-spatial processing
    - Working memory
- Wechsler tests
    - Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test, 4th Edition (WAIS-IV)
    - Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th Edition (WISC-IV)
    - Like the SB5 the Wechsler tests yield
        - A single overall intelligence score
        - A separate score for performance (nonverbal) intelligence
        - A separate score for verbal (language-or symbol-oriented) intelligence.
- Group tests
    - Individual intelligence test: designed to be given to a single person by a trained specialist (e.g., SB5 and the Wechsler tests)
    - Group intelligence tests can be given to a large group of people with minimal supervision (e.g., Army Alpha, SAT Reasoning Test, American College Test, (ACT), College Qualification Test (CQT))

# How do IQ scores relate to age, sex, and occupation ?

- Mental age 心智年齡: average intellectual performance
- Chronological age 實歲: person’s age in years
- (Ratio)IQ=MA/CA * 100(比例)智商
- Deviation IQ 差異智商: scores based on a person’s relative standing in his or her age group; how far above or below average a person’s score is, relative to other scores
- Variations in intelligence
    - Normal (bell-shaped) curve: distribution of observed IQ scores; most scores fall close to the average, and very few are found at the extremes
    - IQ and age: stable after middle childhood
    - IQ and sex: Men and women do not appear to differ in overall intelligence
    - IQ and achievement: a strong correlation (about .50 exists between IQ and school grades
- Gifted children
    - Have a high IQ (usually above 130) or special talents or abilities (play Mozart at age 5)
    - Gifted or not, successful people are persistent and motivated to learn
