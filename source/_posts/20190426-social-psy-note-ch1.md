# Introducing Social Psychology

---

# What is social psychology, and how is it different from other disciplines ?

- Social influence 社會影響
- It is the __scientific study__ of the way in which people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are __influenced__ by the real or imagined presence of other people (實證 empirical)

## Social psychology, philosophy, science and common sense

- Social psychology versus philosophy
    - Address many of the same questions
    - But social psychology explores them __scientifically__
- Social psychology versus common sense
    - Common sense = folk wisdom
    - Social psychologists predict behavior by forming hypotheses and testing them scientifically

## How social psychology differs from its closest cousins

- Social psychology versus personality psychology
    - Personality psychology
        - Focus on individual difference
        - Ignores social influence
- Social psychology versus other social sciences
    - Difference in level of analys
- Social psychology versus sociology
    - Difference in level of analysis
        - Sociology focus on society at large

## The goal of social psychology

- Identify __universal properties of human nature__ that make everyone susceptible to social influence, regardless of social class or culture
- Identify why a particular society or group within a society produces behavior (e.g., aggression) in its members

# Why does it matter how people explain and interpret events - and their own and others' behavior

## The power of the situation

## The importance of explanation

- Fundamental attribution error (FAE) 基本歸因偏誤
    - The tendency to explain our own and other people's behavior entirely __in terms of personality traits__
    - Underestimating the power of social influence
        - When we underestimate the power of social influence, we gain a feeling of false security
            - Increase personal vulnerablilty to possibly destructive social influence
            - Lulls(放鬆警惕) us into lowering our guard
        - By failing to fully appreciate the power of the situation, we tend to
            - Oversimplify complex situation
            - __Decrease our understanding of the true causes__
            - __Blame the victim__ when people are overpowered by social forces

## The importance of interpretation

- How humans will behave in a given situation is not determined by the objective conditions of a situation but rather __how they perceive it (construal 解讀)__
- What exactly do we mean by the social situation ?
- One strategy
    - Identify the objective properties of the situation
    - Document the behaviors that follow from these objective properties
- Behaviorism 行為主義: an objective worldview
    - A school of psychology maintaining that to understand human behavior, one need consider __only reinforcing effects of environment__
    - Choose not to deal with cognition, thinking, and feeling (too vague)
    - Behaviorism ignores construal of the situation
        - Inadequate for understanding the social world
    - __Look at the situation from the viewpoint of the people in it, to see how they construe the world around them__

## Subjectivity of the social situation 情境的主觀性

- __Emphasis on construal__, the way people interpret the social situation, has its roots in Gestalt psychology
- Gestalt psychology 完形心理學
    - A school of psychology stressing the importance of studying the __subjective way in which an object appears in people's minds__ (the gestalt or "whole") rather than the objective, physical atributes of the object
    - Founded in Germany

# What happens when people's need to feel good about themselves conflicts with their need to be accurate ?

## Where construals come from: basic human motives

## Two central motives

- The need ot feel good about ourselves (自尊取向)
    - Many people have a strong need to maintain reasonably high self-esteem
    - __People will often distort the world in order to feel good about themselves instead of representing the world accurately__
    - Suffering and self-justification 受苦與自我合理化
        - The more unpleasant the procedure the participants underwnet to get into a group, the better they liked the group
            - Human beings are motivated to maintain a positive picture of themselves, __in part by justfying their past behavior__
            - Under certain conditions, this leads them to do things that at first glance might seem surprising or paradoxical
- The need to be accurate (社會認知取向)
    - Takes into account how people think about the world
        - We __try to gain accurate understanding so we can make effectice judgments and decisions__
        - But we __typically act on the basis of incompletely and inaccurately interpreted information__ (cognitive bias ?)
    - Social cognition
        - The social cognition perspective views people as "amateur sleuths" doing their best to __understand and predict their social world__
        - How people think about themselves and the social world
        - __How people select, interpret, remember, and use social information to make judgments and decisions__
    - Expectations about the social world
        - Our expectations can even change the nature of the social world
        - Self-fulfilling prophecy 自證預言
            - Teachers expecting specific students to perform will often
                - pay more attention to them
                - listen to them with more respect
                - call on them more frequently
                - encourage them
                - tyr to teach them more challenging material
            - This ,in turn, helps these students feel
                - happier
                - more respected
                - more motivated
                - smarter
