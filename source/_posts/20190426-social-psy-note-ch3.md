# Social Cognition: How We Think About the Social World

---

# What is automatic thinking, and how are schemas an example of that kind of thought ? What are the advantages and disadvantages of schemas ?

## Social cognition

- How people think about themselves and the social world
- How people select, interpret, remember, and use social information to make judgments and decisions

## Two kinds of Social cognition
- __Automatic thinking__
    - Quick
    - No conscious deliberation of thoughts, perceptions, assumptions
        - We often size up a new situation very quickly
        - __大部分的時候是 correct 的__
        - Thinking that is __nonconscious, unintentional, involuntary, and effortless__
        - How ?
            - Relate new situations to past experiences
            - __Schemas__
                - Mental structures that organize our knowledge of the social world
                - __Influences the information people notice, think about, and remember__
- __Controlled thinking__
    - __Effortful__ and deliberate
    - Thinking about self and environment
    - Carefully selecting the right course of action

## People as everyday theorists: automatic thinking with schemas

## Schemas and stereotypes

- When applied to members of a social group such as a fraternity, gender, or race, __schemas are commonly referred to as stereotypes__

## Function of schemas

- Schemas used to
    - Organize what we know
    - __Interpret new situations__
- Korsakov's syndrome
    - Neurological disorder
        - Can't form memories

## Schemas as memory guides

- Helps __fill in the blanks__ when trying to remember
    - Remember some information that was there
    - __Also remember other information that was never there__

## How schemas affect perception

## Which schemas do we use ? Accessibility and priming

- Accessibility 浮現速度
    - The extent to which schemas and concepts are at the forefront of people's minds and are therefore likely to be used when we are making judgments about the social world
- Priming 促發
    - The process by which __recent experience increase the accessibility__ of a schema, trait, or concept

## Accessibility and priming

- Something can become accessible for three reasons
    - Chronically(長期的) accessible due to __past experience__
    - Accessible because it is related to a __current goal__
    - Temporarily accessible because of our __recent experience__

## Making our schemas come true

- The self-fulfilling prophecy 自證預言
    - The case whereby people
        - have an expectation about what another person is like, which;
        - influences how they act toward that person, which;
        - __causes that person to behave consistently with people's original expectation, making the expectations come true__

# What are other types of automatic thinking are how do they operate ?

## Automatic goal pursuit

Prime goals in subtle way to see if it influences behavior

- Example: 看句子、單字然後分硬幣的那個實驗

## Automatic decision making

- __Distracting oneself prior to making decision__
- Ensuring distraction improves decision making
    - Have a conscious goal to make a good choice
    - Decision requires integration of complex information

## Automatic thinking and metaphors about the body and the mind

- Physical sensations can prime metaphors
    - e.g., cleanliness associated with morality; dirtiness with immorality
- Metaphors can influence decisions
    - Holding hot coffee or iced coffee
    - Encounter a stranger
        - Hot coffee: primes "warm & friendly" metaphor
        - Iced coffee: primes "unfriendly people are cold"

## Mental strategies and shortcuts

- Mental shortcuts 心智捷徑
    - Efficient: don't usually have time to fully search all options
    - __Usually__ lead to good decisions quickly
- Schemas are a shortcut people use
    - But we don't have a ready-made schema for every judgment or decision
    - Sometimes there are too many schemas available
- __So what do we do ?__
    - __Judgmental heuristics 捷思__
        - Mental shortcuts people use to make judgments quickly and efficiently

## Availability heuristic 便利捷思

- A mental rule of thumb whereby people base a judgment on the ease with which they can bring something to mind
- Trouble: __sometimes what is easiest to remember is not typical of the overall picture__, leading to faulty conclusions
- Physicians have been found to use the availability heuristic when making diagnoses. Their diagnoses are influenced by how easily they can bring different diseases to mind
- 醫生問診一直問 -> 避免誤診，要把破原先的 availability heuristic

## Availability heuristic and self-judgments

- People were asked to remember either 6 or 12 examples of their own past assertive behaviors
    - People who thought of 6 examples
        - Rated themselves as relatively assertive
        - It was easy to think of this many examples -> "Hey, this is easy, I guess I'm a pretty assertive person"
    - People who thought of 12 examples
        - Rated themselves as relatively unassertive
        - It was difficult to think of this any examples -> "Hmm, this is hard, I must not be a very assertive person"

## How similar is A to B, the representativeness heuristic

- Representativeness heuristic 代表性捷思
    - A mental shortcut whereby people classify something according to __how similar it is to a typical case__
- Base rate information 基底比例資訊
    - Information about the frequency of members of different categories in the population

## Personality tests and the represnetativeness heuristic

- We tend to perceive personality tests as uncannily accurate, known as the "Barnum effect" 巴南效應
- Why does this happen ?
    - Representative heuristic - statements are so __vague__ that __everyone can find a past behavior similar to the feedback__
    - We do not go beyond representative examples that come to mind

# How does culture influence social thinking ?

## Cultural determinants of schemas

- Culturally universal
    - All people have schemas
- Culture differences
    - Content of schemas

## Culture and social cognition

- Analytic thinking style
    - __Focus on objects__ without consdering surrounding context
    - Associated with __Western__ cultures
- Holistic thinking style 整體式思考風格
    - __Focus on the overall context__, relation between objects
    - Assocaited with __Eastern__ cultures

# What are some of the drawbacks of controlled thinking, and how can we improve its effectiveness ?

## Controlled thinking

- Thinking that is conscious, intentional, voluntary, and effortful

## Controlled thinking and free will

- Association between conscious thought and behavior creates perception of free will 自由意志的知覺
    - __But, forces outside of awarenes may influence behavior and conscious thoughts__
        - __May overestimate or underestimate amount of control__
    - Belief in free will predicts behavior
        - Cheating
        - Helping

## Mentally undoing the past

- Counterfactual reasoning 虛擬式理解
    - Mentally changing some aspect of the past in imagining what might have been
        - 如果我那時候...，現在就不會...
    - __Can have a big influence on our emotional reactions to events__
    - __The easier it is to mentally undo an outcome, the stronger the emotional reaction to it__

## Emotional consequences of counterfactual reasoning

- Positive consequences
    - Motivation to improve in future
- Negative consequences
    - If it leads to rumination(沉思) - repetitive focus on negative things -> depression

## Improving human thinking

- Make people more humble
    - Ask people to consider the point of view opposite to their own
- Teach basic statistical principles
    - Facilitated application of principles to everyday life
