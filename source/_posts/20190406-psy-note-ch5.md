# States of Consciousness

---

# What is consciousness ?

- Waking consciousness: normal, clear alert awareness
- Altered state of consciousness (ASC) 意識狀態改變: changes that occus in quality and pattern of mental activity; different from waking consciousness
- Disorder of consciousness
    - Coma
    - Persistent vegetative state 持續性植物狀態 (植物人)

# What is hypnosis ?

- State theories: ASC
- Nonstate theories: hypnosis is not a distinct state; it is a blend of conformity, relaxation, imagination, obedience, role-playing
- Effect of hypnosis
    - Improving physical ability in some sports
    - Increasing memory
    - Producing brief amnesia 失憶
    - Pain relief
    - Producing sensory changes
- Hypnosis cannot...
    - Produce acts of superhuman strength
    - Produce true age regression 退化
    - Force you to do things against your will

# Do meditation and mindfulness have any benefits ?

- Meditation
- Sensory deprivation an relaxation: tranquility in a tank
    - Intense or prolonged sensory deprivation is stressful and disorienting
    - Brief periods of sensory restriction can produce a strong relaxation response. deep relaxation makes people more open to suggestion
    - Mild sensory deprivation may interrupt habitual behavior patterns
        - A way to stimulate creative thinking and enhance sports and music performance
- Forms of meditation
    - Concentrative meditation 專注式冥想
    - Mindfulness meditation 正念靜觀: widening attention to become nonjudgmentally aware of everything

# What are the basic rhythms of sleep ?

- Need for sleep
    - Hypersomnia 嗜睡症: excessive daytime sleepiness, arises after even a few hours of sleep loss
- Sleep patterns: daily rhythms of sleep and waking
    - Older people sleep less than younger people
- EEG and brain waves
    - Electroencephalograph 腦波儀
    - β waves: small, fast, alertness, wakefulness
    - α waves: larger, slower, relaxation, falling asleep
    - δ(delta) waves: largest, slowest, deep sleep
- Stages of sleep
    - Stage 1 (light sleep)
        - Small, irregular waves (people may or may not say they were asleep)
        - Hypnic jerk 入睡抽動
    - Stage 2 (deeper sleep)
        - Sleep spindles: short bursts of distinctive brain-wave activity that appear at threshold of sleep
    - Stage 3 (even deeper sleep)
        - Delta waves appear
    - Stage 4 (deepest level of normal sleep)
        - Almost pure delta waves
    - REM sleep
        - Stage of sleep marked by rapid eye movements, high-frequency brain waves, and dreaming
- REM & Non-REM
    - REM
        - 20 ~ 25% of sleep time, dream
        - Brain wave pattern similar to stage 1 and 2 and awake (paradoxical sleep 矛盾睡眠)
    - Non-REM
        - Less activity, 75 ~ 80% of sleep time
    - 100-minutes cycle (90min NREM + 10min REM), 4 ~ 6 times
    - With each cycle, time of deep sleep (stage 3 & 4) decreases and REM sleep increases

# Why do we sleep ?

- REM rebound: the occurrence of extra REM sleep following REM sleep deprivation
- When we get a good night of sleep, the information that we learned in the hours before sleep gets "solidified" in our memories. This process is called consolidation 固化
- Consolidation may happen more during our early NREM sleep stages than in later REM stages

# Do dreams have meaning ?

- Why do we dream ?
    - Sigmund Freud
        - Dreams gave us insight into a person's unconscious
        - The content of dreams represents a wish fulfillment purpose
        - 夢到的東西 -> manifest content 表明內容
        - 隱藏的涵義 -> latent content 潛伏內容
    - Activation-synthesis hypothesis 激發 - 整合假說
        - Dreams are meaningless
        - 腦袋裡面電流活動有的沒的整合起來變成夢境
    - Neurocognitive theory of dreaming
        - Suggests that when we dream we are continuing the thoughts and emotions of our waking lives

# What are some sleep-wake disorders ?
 
- Insomnia 失眠
    - Remedies for insomnia
        - Stimulus control: linking a particular response with specific stimuli-getting up and going to sleep at the same time everyday; avoid doing anything by sleeping in the bed
        - Sleep restriction: restricting sleep to normal bedtime hours
        - Paradoxical intention 矛盾意向法: trying to keep the eyes open and stay awake as long as possible - removing the pressure of trying to go to sleep
        - Relaxation
        - Exercise
        - Food intake: starchy food (tryptophan 色氨基酸 ↑, serotonin 血清素 in the brain ↑)
        - Stimulant avoidance: avoid coffee, cigarettes (alcohol is not stimulant, yet impairs sleep quality)
- Disorders of arousal
    - Sleepwalk 夢遊
        - Somnambulists are typically not acting out their dreams
        - NREM stages 3 and 4
        - Their eyes are usually open
        - Not dangerous to wake them up
        - You can guide the person back to bed. It’s not necessary to wake them up
    - Sleeptalking 夢囈 / 夢語
        - People pathological talk in their sleep (no, you can’t get their deepest secrets by listening to them)
    - Sleepsex
        - People attempt to have sex while they are fast asleep
- Additional disorders
    - Nightmare disorder
        - Marked by repeated and disruptive frightening dreams
    - Sleep apnea 睡眠呼吸中止症
        - Disturbance of breathing during sleep that may require a machine to treat
    - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) 嬰兒猝死
        - A child dies in their sleep because they fail to reposition themselves and suffocate
    - Narcolepsy 猝睡症
        - When a person experiences episodes of falling asleep directly from a wakeful state
