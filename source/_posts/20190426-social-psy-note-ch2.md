# Methodology: How Social Psychologists Do Research

---

# How do researches develop theories and hypotheses ? 

## Fundamental principle

- Social influence can be studied scientifically

## Hindsight Bias 事後聰明偏誤

__Tendency to exaggerate prediction of an outcome after knowing that it occured__

- Result of some experiments may seen obvious
    - Familiarity with the subject matter
        - Social influence
        - Social behavior
    - Hindsight bias

# Formulating hypotheses and theories

- Like other scientists, social psychologists
    - Develop theories
    - Derive hypotheses from theory
    - Test hypotheses
- Previous theories and research
    - Science is cumulative
        - Dissatisfacation with behaviorism
- Personal observation
    - Kitty Genovese

# What are the strengths and weaknesses of various research designs that social psychologists use ?

## The observational method

- Researcher observes people and systematically records behavior
- e.g.
    - Ethnography 民族誌: description from an "insider's point of view"
    - Archival analysis: researcher examines accumulated documents (傾向 supplemental)
- Interjudge reliability 評分者間信度
    - The level of agreement between two of more people who __independently observe and code a set of data__
    - Do you see what I see ?
    - __Important to establish reliability when observation is used__
- Limits of the observational method
    - Certain behaviors difficult to observe
        - Rarely or private
    - Archival analysis
        - Original may not have all information researchers need
    - __Does not allow prediction and explanation__
        - Limited to description

## The correlational method

- Two or more variables are systematically measured and the __relation between them is assessed__
- Correlation coefficient
    - How well you can __predict one variable from another__

## Serveys

- Representative sample of people asked about attributes or behavior
- Correlations computed using responses to questions

### Using surveys

- A way ensuring that a sample of people is __representative of a population__ by giving everyone in the population an equal chance of being selected for the sample

### Advantages

- Investigate relations between variables __difficult to ibserve__
- Sample representative segments of population (取樣)

### Disadvantages

- Accuracy of responses: people may not know the answer - but they think they do

## Limits of the correlational method

- __Correlation ≠ causation__
- Social psychology's goal
    - __Identify causes__ of social behavior

## The experimental method

- Researchers randomly assigns participants to different conditions
- Conditions are identical except for the __independent variables__ (the one thought to have causal effect on people's responses)
    - Use to answer causal questions
- Independent variable: to be __manipulated__
- Dependent variable: to be __measured__

## Internal validity in experiments 內在效度

- Making sure that nothing besides independent variable can effect dependent variable
- Increasing internal validity
    - Control extraneous variables
    - __Randomly__ assign people to experimental conditions

## Random assignment

- Ensure all participants have equal chance of being in any experimental condition
- __Ensure that difference in participants' personalities or backgrounds are distributed evenly across conditions__

## Probability level (p-value)

- A number calculated with statistical techniques
- Indicates likelihood results of experiment occured by __chance__ instead of the IV(s)
- The convention in science is to consider results __significant__ when
    - Probability is less than 0.05 that the results might be dued to chance factors and not the IV

## Limits of experimental method

- Artificial
- Distant from real life
    - Tradeoff with increasing control over the situation to make it similar for all participants

## External validity in experiments 外在效度

- The extent to which the results of a study __can be generalized__ to other situations and to other people
- Two kinds of external validity (generalizability)
    - Situations: the extent to which we can generalize from the experimental situation to real-lifr situations
        - Psychological realism 心理真實性
            - Psychological process triggered by experiments are similar to psychological process in real life
        - Cover story
            - A description of the purpose of a study, given to participants, that is different from its true purpose, used to maintain psychological realism
    - People: the extent to which we can generalize from the people who participated in the experiment to people in general
        - Random selection of participants from population
            - Impractical and expensive for most social psychology experiments
            - Address by studying basic, fundamental psychological processes that may be universal

## Improving external validity

- Field experiments 田野實驗
    - Advantages
        - Participants __unaware that they are in an experiment__
        - Participants more diverse than typical college sample

## Trade-off between internal and external validity

- Internal validity: randomly assign to conditions and control for extraneous variables
- External validity: generalize to everyday life
- Basic dilemma of the social psychologist
    - Too much control, generalizable ?
    - Too much like real life, control all extraneous variables ?
- The way to resolve this basic dilemma is not to try to do everything in a single experiment

## Test of internal and external validity

- Replications 驗證性研究
    - Repeating a study, often with different subject populations or in different settings
    - __Ultimate test of external validity__
- Meta-analysis 後設分析
    - A statistical technique that averages the results of two or more studies to see if the effect of an independent variable is reliable
    - __Test of internal validity__

## Basic versus applied research

- Basic research 基礎研究
    - Designed to find the best answer to __why people behave as they do__
    - Conducted purely for reasons of intellectual curiosity 就是單純想研究
- Applied research 應用研究
    - Designed to solve a particular social problem

# What impact do cross-cultural studies, the evoluntionary approach, and social neuroscience research have on the way in which scientists investigate social behavior ?

## Cross-cultural research

- Conducted with different cultures, to see if psychological processes are present in both cultures or specific to the culture in which people were raised

## Issues in cross-cultural research

- Researchers must
    - Guard against imposing their own cultural viewpoints onto an unfamiliar culture
    - Ensure that IV and DV are understood in the same way in different cultures

## The evolutionary approach

- Evolutionary theory
    - 達爾文, explain how animals adapt to their environments
- Natural selection
    - How heritable traits that promote survival in a particular environment are passed along to future generations
    - Organisms with those traits are more likely to produce offspring

## Evolutionary psychology

- Attempts to explain social behavior in terms of genetic factors that have evolved over time according to the principles of natural selection
- Core idea
    - Social behavior prevalent today are due, in part, to adaptions to past environments
- __Impossible to test with experimental method__

## Social neuroscience

- Examines the connection between biological processes and social behavior
- Technologies used include:
    - Electroencephalography (EEG)
        - electrodes are placed on the scalp to measure electical activity in the brain
    - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
        - in which people are placed in scanners that measure changes in blood flow in their brains

# How do social psychologists ensure the safety and welfare of their research participants, while at the smae time testing hypotheses about the causes of social behavior ?

## Two goals in conflict

- Ethical dilemma
    - Create experiments that resemble the real world and are well controlled
    - Avoid causing participants stress, discomfort, or unpleasantness

## Deception and debriefing

- Deception
    - Misleading participants about the true purpose of a study or the events that will actually transpire(透露)
    - People do not object to mild discomfort and deception
    - Not all research in social psychology involves deception
- Debriefing 釋疑面談
    - Explaining to participants, __at the end of an experiment__, the true purpose of the study and exactly what transpired

## Guidelines for ethical research

- Submit to institutional review board
- Must include at least one scientist, one nonscientist, and one person who is not affiliated with the institution
