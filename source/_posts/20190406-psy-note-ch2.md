# Brain and Behavior

# What are the major divisions of the nervous system ?

- Parasympathetic (housekeeper)
- Sympathetic (trouble shooter)

# How do nervous operate and communicate with each other ?

- 突觸跟一堆神經傳導物質 去看講義圖片
- if 失調
    - Alzheimer's disease
    - Parkinson's disease 
    - Schizophrenia 思覺失調症
    - Autism
    - Anxiety
    - Depression

# How does the nervous system change and grow ?

- Neuroplasticity
- Neurogenesis 

# How do the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex differ ?

- Two halves => hemispheres
- Hemispheres are connected by corpus callosum(胼胝體)
- Hemispheres lateralization(側化): Certain functions are controlled more by the left or right hemispheres
- Spatial neglect 空間忽略
    - May pay not attention to one side visual space
    - May emerge in response to damage to one of the uhemispheres
- Hemispheric dominance: left-brain/right-brain dominant
- Handedness: right-handed 右利/left-handed 左利
- Split-brain 腦裂
    - Corpus callosum is severed 切斷
- Male and female brain
    - Men => front to back => go quickly from perception
    - Women => side to side => rationality, intuition

# What are the different functions of the lobes of the cerebral cortex ?

- Parietal lobe 頂葉
    - Sensation: touch, temperature, pressure
- Occipital lobe 枕葉
    - Final destination for visual information
- Temporal lobe 顳葉
    - Posture, coordination, muscle tone, memory of skills and habits
    - Hearing
- Frontal lobe 額葉
    - Sense of self, motor control, higher mental abilities, cognitive activities
    - Mirror neurons 鏡神經元: 同理心 
- Motor cortex
    - Voluntary muscles 隨意肌
    - Frontal lobe
- Somatosensory cortex
    - Parietal lobe: communicating with the opposite side of the body
- Auditory cortex
    - Temporal lobe
- Visual cortex
    - Occipital lobe
- Association cortex 聯合皮質
    - High-level brain processes

# What are the major parts of the subcortex ?

- Hindbrain 後腦
    - Medulla 延髓
    - Pons 橋腦
    - Cerebellum 小腦
- Midbrain 中腦
    - Connecting the hindbrain and forebrain
- Reticular formation: flows from the hindbrain through the midbrain
- Locked-in syndrome 閉鎖症候群
    - Damage to the brainstem
    - Is unable to move or communicate but still cognizant of what is happening around them
- Thalamus 視丘: sensory info
- Hypothalamus 下視丘: manage body's internal state
- Cerebellum 小腦: regulates coordinated movement
- Brain stem: general alertness, warning system
- Limbic system 邊緣系統: regulates emotions and motivated behavior
    - Hippocampus 海馬迴: memories
    - Amygdala 杏仁核: emotion, aggression
    - Hypothalamus 下視丘: 高級神經系統 內分泌控管
        - Sending messages to the pituitary gland (腦下垂體)

# How does the endocrine system affect behavior ?
