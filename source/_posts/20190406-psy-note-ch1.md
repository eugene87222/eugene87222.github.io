# Psychology, Critical Thinking, and Science

Definition: scientific study of the __behavior of individuals and their mental processes__.

---

# Why is common sense not enough ?

- Ignore the need for critical scientific inquiry.
- Uncritical acceptance of a given piece of information 
    - The info comes from a trusted source 
    - A lack of significant, supporting evidence 
    - Hearing the claim made over and over again
    - A desire for the assertion to be true 
- Confirmation bias
    - We attend only to data that support our belief and ignore data that refuse them 
- Pseudoscience 
    - Might involve claims that appear to be legitimate or scientific but fail to satisfy any true scientific standard 
        - Astrology 
        - Superstition 
        - Phrenology 
        - Graphology
- Empiricism 
    - To improve on "commonsense" knowledge using scientific observation rather than casual observation
        - Systematic (carefully planned)
        - Intersubjective (confirmable by more than one observer)

# Why is introspection unreliable ?

- Structuralism 
    - Stimuli <=> Response
    - The study of sensations and personal experience analyzed a basic elements 
    - Elements of mind
    - Introspection: all human mental experience can be understood as combination of simple elements or events
- Gestalt psychology 
    - Study experiences of thinking, learning, perception as whole units, not by analyzing them into parts
- Functionalism
    - Study of psychology that considers behavior in terms of active adaptions
    - How the mind, perception, habits and emotions help us adapt and survive
- Shortcomings of introspection 
    - Imageless thought 無形象思考 
        - Mental processes of which are not subjectively aware; not open to introspection (= cognitive unconscious 潛意識認知)
        - e.g., series position on shopper’s preference
- Introspection is not the best way to study the mind but why it is still widely used ?
    - Self-report data: info provided by participants about their own thoughts, emotions or behavior

# How did psychology deal with the limitations of introspection ?

- Behaviorism 行為主義
    - Stimuli <=> Response
    - Classical conditioning 古典制約
    - Operant conditioning 操作制約
- Psychoanalysis 
    - Sigmund Freud
        - Behavior is largely influenced by unconscious wishes, thoughts, and desires, especially sex and aggression
        - Repression occurs when threatening thoughts are unconsciously held out of awareness 
        - Dynamic unconscious 
        - Psychodynamic theories 心理動力: internal motives, conflicts, unconscious forces 
- Humanism 
    - Free will
    - Ability to choose one’s own path was the correct approach
    - Positive growth and striving for self-actualization 
- Biopsychology 
    - 反正就是科學

# How do cognitive psychologists objectively study subjective mental process ?

- Phenomenon that cannot be directly observed
- Thinking, memory, intelligence 
- The importance of operational definition 操作型定義: specifying exactly what is being examined and how it is described and measured

# What is the biopsychosocial model ?

- Biological, psychological, social factors interact to influence human behavior and metals processes
- Biological perspective
- Psychological perspective
- Social perspective
    - Social norms
    - Cultural relativity 
- Positive psychology
    - Human strength, virtues, optimal behavior

# How are critical thinking and the scientific method used to archive the goals of contemporary psychology ?

- Goals of psychology 
    - Description (What ?)
    - Understanding / explanation (Why ?)
    - Prediction (Will it occur again ? If so, how ?)
    - Control (How can we influence or affect behavior)
- Five principles of critical thinking
    - Few truths transcend the need for logical analysis and empirical testing 
    - Authority or claimed expertise does not automatically make an idea true or false
    - Judging the quality of the evidence is crucial
    - Open mind
    - Try to show “true” is false: Falsification 否證
- Operational definition 操作型定義
    - Goal focus: 離目標還有多少
    - Achievement focus: 已經做了多少 => 里程碑

# How is an experiment performed ?

- Randomly assign (IMPORTANT)
    - Experimental groups: experience the independent variable 
    - Control groups: do NOT experience independent variable 
- Independent variable 導致 dependent variable
- Controlling extraneous variables 
- Statistically significant 統計上顯著
- Meta-analysis 後設分析: a study of results of other studies

# Double-blind study

- Double-blind study: research in which neither the observer nor the subjects know which subjects received which treatment
- Single-blind study: research in which the subjects do now know which treat they receive 
- Subjects 受試者
- Participants 參與者

# What descriptive research method do psychologist use ?

- Naturalistic observation
    - Observer effect 觀察者效應: changes in subjects behavior caused by an awareness of being observed
- Correlational research
    - Examine the relationship between two variables WITHOUT drawing cause-and-effect conclusions
    - Correlation coefficient 
- Case study / clinical method
- Survey method 
    - Self-report data
    - Easy to do and can gather large amounts of data
    - BUT:
        - does the sample used represent the larger population from which it was drawn ?
        - is the sample biased ?
        - are the participants honest ?
