# Attitudes and Attitude Change: Influencing Thoughts and Feelings

---

# What are the different kinds of attitudes and on what are they based ?

- Attitudes
   - Evaluations of people, objects, and ideas

## The nature and origin of attitudes

- People are not neutral observers of the world
   - They __evaluate what they encounter__
   - They form attitudes
- Attitudes are made up of three components
   - Affective 情感的
      - Emotional reaction
   - Behavioral
   - Cognitive

## Where do attitudes come from ?

- Genetic origins ?
   - Identical twins share more attitudes that fraternal twins
   - Indirect function of our genes
      - Temperament, personality
- Social experience

## Cognitively based attitude 以認知為基礎的態度

## Affectively based attitude 以情感為基礎的態度

- Affectively based attitudes don't come from examining facts
   - Where do they come from ?
      - Values 價值觀
      - Sensory reaction 感官反應
      - Aesthetic reaction 美感反應

## Behaviorally based attitude 以行為為基礎的態度

- An attitude based on __observations__ of how one behaves toward an attitude object

## Self-perception theory 自我知覺論

- Sometimes people do not know how they feel until they see how they behave
   - Can form our attitudes based on our __observations__ of our own behavior
- People infer their attitude from their behavior only under certain conditions
   - When initial attitude is weak or __ambiguous__
   - When no other plausible explanation for behavior

## Explicit versus implicit attitudes

- Explicit attitudes
   - Attitudes that we consciously endorse and can easily report
- Implicit attitudes
   - Attitudes that are involuntary, uncontrollable, and at times unconscious 非自願、不可控制、有時沒意識到的

# Under what conditions do attitudes predict behavior ?

## Predicting spontaneous behaviors

- Attitudes will predict spontaneous behavior only when they are highly accessible to people
- __Attitude accessibility__ 態度可接近性
   - __The strength of the association between an attitude object and a person's evaluation of that object__, measured by the __speed__ with which people can report how they feel about the object

## Predicting deliberative behavior 預測深思行為

- Theory of planned behavior 規劃行為論
   - People's intentions are the best predictors of their deliberate behaviors
- Specific attitudes
   - Only specific attitudes can be expected to predict that behavior
- Subjective norms 主觀規範
   - We also need to measure people's subjective norms - their beliefs about how people they care about will view the behavior in question
- Perceived behavioral control 知覺到的行為控制力
   - Intentions are influenced by the ease with which they believe they can perform the behavior

# How do internal and external factors lead to attitude change ?

## Attitude changes and social influence 

- When attitudes change, it is often due to social influence
   - This is why social psychologists are interested
   - Attitudes are social phenomena

## Changing attitudes by changing behavior

- People experience dissonance
   - When their image is threatened
   - When they cannot explain behavior with external justifications
      - Leads to finding internal justification for behavior
      - __Brings your attitude and your behavior closer together__ (equals attitude change)

## Persuasive communications and attitude change

- Communication __advocating a particular side of an issue__
- How should you construct a message so that it would really change people's attitudes ?
- __Yale attitude change approach__
   - "Who said what to whom"
      - Who: the __source__ of the __communication__
      - What: the __nature__ of the __communication__
      - Whom: the __nature__ of the __audience__

## The central an peripheral routes to persuasion 中心與周邊說服路徑

- __Elaboration likelihood model__ 推敲可能性模型
   - Central route
      - When people __are motivated__ and __have the ability to pay attention__ to the arguments in the communication
      - Persuasion
         - Elaborate on a persuasive communication
            - Listening carefully to and thinking about the arguments
            - Occurs when people __have both the ability and the motivation__ to listen carefully
   - Peripheral route
      - When people __do not pay attention__ to the arguments but are instead swayed by surface characteristics
      - Persuasion
         - People do not elaborate on the arguments
         - People can be swayed by __peripheral cues__, such as by who delivers a persuasive message rather than by the strength of the message itself. An example is when consumers buy certain products because a celebrity tweets about them (代言)

## The motivation to pay attention to the arguments

- Personal relevance of the topic
- People high in the need for cognition
   - Form attitudes through central route
- People low in the need for cognition
   - Rely in peripheral cues

## The ability to pay attention to the arguments

- When people are unable to pay close attention to the arguments, they are swayed more by peripheral cues
   - Status of communicators
   - Liking or trusting communicators
- Someone with a weak argument can still be persuasive if they __distract their audience__

## How to achieve long-lasting attitude change

- People who __base their attitudes on a careful analysis__ of the arguments will be
   - More likely to maintain the attitude
   - More likely to behave consistently with this attitude
   - __More resistant to counter-persuasion__

## Fear-arousing communications

- Persuasive messages that attempt to __change people's attitudes by arousing their fear__
- Strong amounts of fear fail if they overwhelm people
   - __Become defensive__
   - Deny importance of threat
   - __Cannot think rationally about issue__
- Do fear-arousing communications work ?
   - __Modern amounts__ of fear work best
   - Provide information on how to reduce fear

## Emotions as a heuristic

- Heuristic-systematic model of persuasion
   - Systematically processing the merits(價值) of the arguments
   - When using peripheral route
      - __Use mental shortcuts__ (heuristics)
      - Use emotions as heuristic to determine attitude
- Advertisers and retailers want to create good feelings about their product
   - Pair product with appealing music or showing pleasant images
      - Hope people will attribute feelings to the product

## Emotion and different types of attitudes

- Several studies have shown that it is best to "fight fire with fire"
   - If an attitude is __cognitively based__
      - Change it with __rational arguments__
   - If an attitude is __affectively based__
      - Change it with __emotional appeals__
- Some ads stress the objective merits of a product
   - $$$, reliability, efficiency
- Other ads stress emotions and values
   - Sex, beauty, youthfulness

## Attitude change and the body

- __Body posture plays a significant role in attitude change__

# How does advertising work to change people's attitudes ?

## Advertising can change attitudes

- People more influenced by advertising than they think
- Split cable market tests
   - Advertisers work with cable companies and stores
   - Show commercial to randomly selected group of people and keep track of purchase
   - Results of over 300 of these reveal ads effective especially for new products
- Public health campaigns
   - Meta-analysis on ads and substance use among youths encouraging
   - Television and radio better than print ads

## How advertising works

- Many take __emotional approach__ of attitude change
   - Little difference between brands
   - __Associate product with excitement, youth, sexual attraction__
- Attitudes that are more cognitively based
   - Personally relevant ?
      - Yes, then use __logical__, __fact-based__ arguments
      - No, might use __peripheral route__
      - Peripheral route leads to attitude change that is _not long lasting__
      - Goal to make product personally relevant

## Subliminal advertising: a form of mind control ?

- There is no evidence that the types of subliminal messages encountered in everyday life have any influence on people's behavior
- Subliminal messages 閾下知覺訊息
   - Words or pictures that are __not consciously perceived__ but may nevertheless influence people's judgments, attitudes, and behavior

## Laboratory evidence for subliminal influence

- Evidence for subliminal influence in carefully controlled laboratory conditions
- Subliminal effects __require a controlled environment__
   - Correct illumination of the room
   - __No distraction__
   - Right distance from screen
- Limitations
   - No evidence that subliminal message can get people to act counter to wishes, values, or personalities

## Advertising, stereotypes, and culture

- Advertisements transmit cultural stereotypes in their words and images, __subtly linking products with desired images__
- Advertisements can also __reinforce and perpetuate stereotypical ways__ of thinking about social groups
- Advertising both __reflects and shapes the biases present in our society__, as demonstrated by the divergent responses to a 2013 Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family

## Gender stereotypes and expectations

- Gender stereotypes are particularly pervasive in advertising imagery
- __Gender roles__

## Culture and advertising

- Western cultures
   - Ads stress independence
   - "It's easy when you have the right shoes"
   - May base attitudes more on __individuality and self-improvement__
- Eastern cultures
   - Ads stress interdependence
   - "The shoes for your family"
   - May base attitudes more on standing in __social group__

# What are some strategies for resisting efforts at persuasion ?

## Attitude inoculation 態度預防接種

Making people immune to attempts to change their attitudes __by initially exposing them to small doses of the arguments against their position__

## Being alert to product placement 置入性行銷

- Before kids watch TV or go off to the movies, it is good to remind them that they are likely to encounter several attempts to change their attitudes

## Resisting peer pressure

## When persuasion attempts boomerang: reactance theory

- Reactance theory 抗拒論
   - People feel their freedom to perform a certain behavior is threatened, an unpleasant state of reactance is aroused, which they can reduce by performing the threatened behavior
