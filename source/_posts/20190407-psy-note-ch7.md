# Stage of memory

- 3 stages of memory: Atkinson-Schiffrin Model
    - Memory: active system that receives, stores, organizes, alters, and recovers information
    - Sensory memory 感覺記憶
    - Short-term memory (STM) 短期記憶
    - Long-term memory (LTM) 長期記憶
- Key peocesses
    - Encoding 收錄: converting info into a usable form
    - Storage
    - Retrieval 提取
- Sensory memory: stores an exact copy of incoming info for a few seconds or less (either what is seen or heard)
    - We are normally unaware of sensory memory
    - Selective attention to sensory memory transfers information to STM
    - Iconic memory 影像記憶 (半秒)
    - Echoic memory (2秒)

# Short-term (working) memory

- We are consciously aware of short-term memories
- Encoding in STM is usually phonetic, by sound
- Very sensitive to interruption or interference
- Working memory: part of STM, like a mental scratchpad
- 保留最近的經驗 or 從 LTM 提取
- Rehearsal in STM
    - Maintenance rehearsal 維持性複誦
        - Rote rehearsal (rote learning) 反覆複誦: the use of repetition to transfer information to LTM; "not very effective"
    - Elaborative processing / rehearsal 精緻性處理 / 複誦: links new information with existing memories and knowledge in LTM; more effective way to transfer information to LTM
- Chunking in STM

# Long-term memory

- Encoding in LTM is usually based on meaning
- 20 memories
    - American: me
    - Chinese: us
- LTM memories are only rarely permanent
- Elaborative processing can revise memories on basis of reasoning or adding new, possibly false, information
    - False memories 虛假記憶: can seem accurate but they "never happened"
    - Source confusion 來源混淆: occurs when the origins of a memory are "misremembered"
- Organize memories
    - Network model 網路模型: LTM stored as a network of linked ideas
    - Reintegration 重整: memories that are reconstructed or expanded by starting with one memory and then following network of links to related memories
    - Cognitive interview 認知晤談: using reintegration to improve the memory of eyewitnesses (Geiselman & Fisher, 1987)
        - Use of various cues and strategies to improve eyewitness memory
        - Recreating the crime scene and witnesses revisit the scene in their imagination or in person
        - 35% more correct information than standard questioning
- Types of LTM
    - Procedural (skilled) memory 程序記憶: LTM for conditioned responses and learned skills (how to do things)
    - Declarative (fact) memory 陳述性記憶: LTM for factual information
        - Semantic memory 語意記憶: part of declarative memory for impersonal facts and everyday knowledge
        - Episodic memory 個人事件記憶 / 情節記憶: part of declarative memory for personal experiences linked with specific times and places

# Measuring memory

- You either remember or you don't ? not really
- Partial memories are common
    - Tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state: feeling that a memory is available but not quite retrievable
    - Feeling of knowing: feeling that allows people to predict beforehand whether they will be able to remember something
    - Déjà vu 似曾相識: the feeling that you have already experienced a situation that you are experiencing for the first time
- Recall 回憶: direct retrieval of facts or info
    - Hardest to recall items in the middle of an ordered list; known as the "serial position effect" 序列位置效應
    - Easier to remember first and last items in a list
- Recognition: previously learned material is correctly identified
    - Usually superior to recall
    - Distractors 誘答選項: false items included with a correct item
        - Wrong choices on multiple-choice tests
    - How to prevent false identification of witnesses (black, tall, young)
        - It’s better to have all the distractors look like the person witnesses described
        - Witnesses should be warned that the culprit may not be present
        - Better to show one photo at a time (a sequential lineup). for each photo, the witness must decide whether the person is the culprit before another photo is shown
- Relearning: 
    - Used to measure memory of prior learning
    - Savings scores 省時分數: amount of time saved when relearning info
- Implicit and explicit memories
    - Explicit memory 外顯記憶: past experiences that are "consciously" brought to mind
    - Implicit memory 內隱記憶: a memory not known to exist; memory that is "unconsciously" retrieved
        - Priming 促發: when cues are used to activate hidden memories

# Forgetting

- Forgetting in LTM
    - Curve of forgetting 遺忘曲線: graph that shows the amount of memory information remembered after varying lengths of time
    - Nonsense syllables 無意義音節: meaningless three-letter words (fej, quf) that test learning and forgetting
- Encoding failure in LTM
    - Encoding failure 收錄失敗: when a memory was never formed in the first place; failure to store sufficient info to form a useful memory
    - Other people may all "look alike" due to encoding failure (臉盲?)
- Storage failure in LTM
    - Memory traces 記憶痕跡: "physical changes" in nerve cells or brain activity that occur when memories are stored
    - Memory decay 記憶(痕跡)衰退: when memory traces become weaker; fading or weakening of memories
    - Disuse 不用: theory that memory traces weaken when memories are not periodically used or retrieved
- Retrieval failure in LTM: cue-dependent forgetting
    - Cue-dependent forgetting 線索依賴的遺忘: failure to access memories due to the "missing of retrieval cues"
    - Availability 可獲得性: a memory is available when it is stored in LTM
    - Accessibility 易取性: a memory is accessible in LTM when it can be successfully retrieved
    - Information in LTM can be available but NOT accessible
    - Memory cue 記憶線索: any stimulus associated with a memory; usually enhances retrieval of a memory
        - A person may "forget" (be inaccessible) if cues are missing at retrieval time
- State-dependent learning 狀態依賴式記憶
    - State-dependent learning 狀態關連學習: when memory retrieval is influenced by bodily state at time of learning; if your body state is the same at the time of learning AND the time of retrieval, retrieval will be improved
    - The effect of mood on memory: emotional cues and memory
        - When you are happy, more likely to remember recent happy events
        - When you are in a bad mood, more likely to remember unpleasant events
- Interference 干擾
    - Tendency for new memories to impair retrieval of older memories, and the reverse
    - Retroactive interference 逆向干擾: tendency for new memories to interfere with retrieval of old memories (新的搞舊的)
    - Proactive interference 前向干擾: prior learning inhibits (interferes with) recall of later learning (舊的搞新的)
- Transfer of training
    - Positive transfer 正遷移: mastery of one task aids learning or performing another
        - Riding a bicycle (balance and turn) and riding a motorcycle
    - Negative transfer 負遷移: mastery of one task conflicts with learning or performing another
        - Back up a car and back up a car with a trailer attached to it
        - A pull-type handle on a door that must be pushed open
- Repression and suppression
    - Repression 潛抑: "unconsciously" pushing painful, embarrassing, or threatening memories out of awareness / consciousness
        - Motivated forgetting
    - Suppression 壓抑: "consciously" putting something painful or threatening out of mind or trying to keep it from entering awareness
        - To avoid thoughts associated with a painful emotional event
- The recovered memory / false memory debate 記憶恢復或假記憶的爭論
    - "Recovered" repressed memories of sexual abuse
    - It is easy to create false memories by using hypnosis
    - Studies of false memories: Elizabeth Loftus
        - Misinformation and false memory
- Eyewitness memory 證人記憶
    - Elizabeth Loftus (1979)
    - Postevent information 事後訊息可以造成扭曲
        - Speed estimate-smash: 40+ mile/hr; contact: 30 mile/hr
        - Broken glass? Smash: 1/3; contact 14% (其實沒有)
    - Misinformation effect 錯誤訊息效應
        - Stop / yield misleading question study: stop sign (75% correct recognition) vs. yield sign (41% correct) (originally: a stop sign)
    - More confidence, higher accuracy ? NO
    - Children’s memory and witness: Steven Ceciand colleagues
        - Younger children are not reliable
        - Under pressure, provide what adults want
        - Mix others’ stories with own experiences

# Memory and brain

- Consolidation
    - Consolidation 固化: forming a LTM in the brain
    - Retrograde amnesia 回溯性失憶症 / "逆向"失憶症: forgetting events that occurred before an injury or trauma
    - Anterograde amnesia 前向失憶症 / "順向"失憶症: forgetting events that follow an injury or trauma
    - Electroconvulsive shock (ECS): mild electrical shock passed through the brain can prevent consolidation of any memory being formed at the time
- Memory formation and the hippocampus
    - Hippocampus 海馬迴: brain structure associated with emotion and transfer of information passing from STM into LTM
    - If damaged, person can no longer "create" LTM and thus will always live in the present
    - Memories prior to damage will remain intact
    - H.M.
- Memory, stress, and emotion
    - Flashbulb memory 閃光燈記憶: especially vivid and detailed recollection of an emotional event (during times of personal tragedy, accident, or other emotionally significant events, e.g.,9/11 2001 & 921 earthquake)
    - Includes both positive and negative experiences; great confidence is placed in them even though they may be inaccurate
    - Due to involvement of limbic system 邊緣系統
- long-term potentiation 長效增益
    - Brain mechanism used to form lasting memories by strengthening the connection between neurons that become more active at the same time

# Exceptional memory

- Eidetic imagery 全現心像 (photographic memory 如照片般清晰的記憶): occurs when a person (usually a child) has visual images clear enough to be scanned or retained for at least 30 seconds
    - Usually projected onto a "plain" surface, like a blank piece of paper
    - Usually disappears during adolescence and is rare by adulthood (8% of preadolescent children, no adults)
- Jill Price: exceptional episodic memory (highly superior autobiographical memory)
    - "…I run my entire life through my head every day and it drives me crazy!!!"
    - He had to devise ways to forget (such as writing on a piece of paper and then burn it)
- Mr. S: exceptional semantic memory
    - Special memory tricks: mnemonics

# Improving memory

- Encoding strategies
    - Use "chunking" to organize information
    - Use "mental images"
    - Elaborative processing: look for connections to existing knowledge
    - Whole learning vs. part learning (study the largest meaningful amount of information you can at one time)
        - Short, organized info -> whole learning
        - Long, complicated info -> part learning
        - Progressive-part method 遞進分習法: for very long or complex material, break a learning task into a series of shorter sections (A, AB, ABC)
    - Beware serial position 序列位置: since most errors occur while remembering the middle of the list, spend more study time there
    - Encode retrieval cues: stimuli that aid retrieval are most effective if they were present during encoding; engage in more elaborative encoding to increase the number of available retrieval cues
    - Overlearning 過度學習: continue studying beyond bare mastery
    - Spaced practice 分散練習: alternate short study sessions with brief rest periods; better than massed practice, studying for long periods without rest periods (chunking)
- Retrieval strategies
    - Cognitive interview: hits for recapturing context and jogging memories
        - Say or write down everything you can remember
        - Recall events or information in different orders
        - Recall from different viewpoints
        - Mentally return to the context of encoding
    - Retrieval practice: practice retrieval (e.g., through recitation) for feedback
        - Knowledge of results: lets you check progress
        - Recitation: summarizing aloud while learning
    - Extend how long you remember: lengthen the amount of time between retrieval practice
    - Clear your mind and prepare your body
        - Lack of sleep decreases retention; sleep aids consolidation
        - Hunger decreases retention

# Mnemonics: memory "Trick"

- Any kind of memory system or aid
    - Makes things meaningful
    - Makes info familiar
    - Uses mental pictures
    - Forms bizarre, unusual, or exaggerated mental associations
- Create Acrostics 藏頭詩
- Create Mental Images
    - Keyword method: aid to memory; using a familiar word or image to link two items
- Create stories of chains: remember lists in order, forming an exaggerated association connecting item one to two, and so on
    - Method of Loci: take a mental walk, mentally walk along a familiar path, placing objects or ideas along the path
