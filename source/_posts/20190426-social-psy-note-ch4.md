# Social Perception: How We Come to Understand Other People

---

# How do people use nonverbal cues to understand others ?

## Social perception

> When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue another, a practiced man relies on the language of the first.  
> \- Ralph Waldo Emerson, _Ther Conduct of Life_

- Why are people the way they are ?
- Why do people act the way do ?
    - Thinking about people and their bahavior helps us to understand and predict our social world
- The study of how we form impressions of and make inferences about other people

## Nonverbal Behavior

- Evolution and facial expressions
    - Crown jewel of nonverbal communication: __the facial expressions channel__
    - Encode: express
    - Decode: interpret
    - Darwin
        - Nonverbal forms of communications is species, not culture, specific
        - e.g.
            - Fear: enhanced perception - facial and eye movements inxrease sensory input
            - Disgust: decreased perception - facial and eye movements decrease sensory input

Facial expressions of emotion are universal - anger, happiness, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness

## Why is decoding sometimes difficult ?

- Affect blends 情感混和

## Culture and the channels of nonverbal communication

- Display rules
    - Dictate what kinds of emotional expressions people are supposed to show
    - Are __culture-specific__
- Display of emotion
    - American: men discouraged from emotional displays like crying, but women allowed
    - Japan: women discouraged from displaying uninhibited smile
- Eye contact / gaze
    - America: suspicious when people do not "look them in the eye"
    - Nigeria, Puerto Rico, Thailand: direct eye contact considered disrespectful
- Personal space
    - America: like bubble of personal space
    - Middle East, South America, southern Europe" stand close to each other and touch frequently

## Emblems 象徵

- Nonverbal gestures that have well-understood definitions within a given culture
- Usually have direct verbal translations , like the "OK" sign
- __Not universal__

# How quickly do first impression form, and why do they persist ?

Impressions based on the slightest of cues

- "Judging a book by its cover"
    - Easily observable things we can __see__ and __hear__
    - __Crucial to first impression__

## How quickly do first impressions form ?

- Form initial impressions based on facial appearance in less than 100 milliseconds (Bar, Neta, & Linz, 2006; Wiils & Todorov, 2006)
- Infer character from faces as young as 3 years old (Cogsdill, Todorov, Spelke, & Banaji, 2014)
- e.g., baby faces
    - Features that are reminiscent(回憶) of those of small children (e.g., big eyes, small chin and nose, high forehead)
    - Tend to be perceived as having childlike traits

## Thin-slicing 薄片擷取

- __Limited exposure can lead to meaningful first impressions of abilities and personalities__
- Thin-slicing
    - Drawing meaningful conclusions about another person's personality or skills __based on an extermely brief sample of behavior__

## The lingering(徘徊) influence of initial impressions

- Primacy effect 初始效應
    - When it comes to forming impressions, __the first traits we perceive in others influence how we view information that we learn about them later__
- Belief perseverance 信念的堅持
    - __The tendency to stick with an initial judgment__ even in the face of new information that should prompt us to reconsider

## Using first impressions and nonverbal communication to our advantage

- Public speaking
    - Make sure opening is strong
- Job interview
    - Dress, eye contact, body posture all affect evaluations
- Hand shake qaulity
- Body language
    - Power posing

# How do people determine why others do what they do ?

- Two theories
    - Attribution theory 歸因論
    - Covariation model 共變模型

## The nature of the attribute process

- Heider
    - "Father" of attribute theory
    - "Naive" or "commonsense" psychology
        - Viewed people as amateur scientists
            - Piece together information to figure out cause
- Attribute theory
    - The way in which people explain the causes of their own and other people's behavior
- When deciding about causes of behavior, we can make one of two attributions
    - Internal, dispositional attribution 內歸因，個人特性歸因
        - Infer a person is behaving in a certain way because of something __about the person__ (e.g., attitude, character, personality)
    - External, situational attribution 外歸因，情境歸因
        - Infer a person is behacing a certain way because of something __about the situation__

## The covariation model: internal versus external attributions

- A theory that states that to form an attribution about what caused a person's behavior, we systematically note the pattern between the presence or absence of possible causal factors and whether not the behavior occurs
- Focuses on __how behavior covaries__
    - Across time, place actors, and targets
- Examines how perceiver chooses an internal or an external attribution
- We make choices about internal versus external attributions by using three pieces of information
    - Consensus 共識 (別人面對相同刺激與主角有相同行為表現的程度)
        - The extent to which other people behave the __same way toward the same stimulus__ as the actor does
    - Distinctiveness 區別 (主角面對不同刺激行為表現相同的程度)
        - The extent to which one particular actor __behaves in the same way to different stimuli__
    - Consistency 一致 (跨情境和時間，主角面對某一次刺激表現相同行為的程度)
        - The extent to which the behavior between one actor and one stimulus is the same __across time and circumstances__

## When internal attribution occurs

- Internal attribution occurs when
    - __Consensus = Low__
        - Behavior is unique to the person
    - __Distinctiveness = Low__
        - Person displays same behavior with different targets and in different situations
    - __Consistency = High__
        - The person's behavior occurs reliably across occasions

## When external attribution occurs

- External attribution occurs when
    - __Consensus = High__
        - Other people behave similarly in the situation
    - __Distinctiveness = High__
        - The person's behavior is specific to that situation or target
    - __Consistency = High__
        - The person's behavior occurs reliably across occasions

## Evaluation of the covariation model

- Information about all three dimensions may not be available
    - People still make attributions
- __Consistency and distinctiveness used more than consensus__

## The fundamental attribution error 基本歸因誤差

- Tend to make internal attributes for other people's behavior and underestimate the role of situational factors

## The role of perceptual salience 知覺顯著性 in the fundamental attribution error

- Why does the fundamental attribution error occur
    - __Tend to focus on person__, not the surrounding situation
    - Use the focus of attention as a starting point

## The two-step attribution process

- Make an internal attribution
    - Assume that a person's behavior was due to something about that person
    - Occurs quickly, spontaneously
- Adjust attribution by considering the situation
    - May fail to make enought adjustment in second step
    - Requires effort, conscious attention
- Engage in the second step if
    - You consciously slow down, think carefully before reaching a judgment
    - You are motivated to reach an accurate judgment
    - You are suspicious about the behavior
- Two-step model less applicable in cultures where internal attributions not the default

## Self-serving attributions 自利歸因

- Explanations for one's successes that credit internal, dispositional factors, and explanations for one's failures that blame external, situational factors
- Why do we make self-serving attributions
    - __Maintain self-esteem__
    - Want other to think well of us and admire us
    - We know more about the situational factors that affect our own behavior than we do about other people's

## Belief in a just world 公平世界的信念

- __The assumption that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get__
- __Type of defensive attribution__
- Advantage
    - Allows people to deal with feelings of vulnerability, mortality
- Disadvantage
    - __Blaming the victim__

## The "bias blind spot"

- People realize biases in attribution can occur
- __Believe other people more susceptible to attributional biases compared to self__

# What role does culture play in processes of socoal perception and attribution ?

## Holistic versus analytic thinking

- Analytic thinking
    - Values in __Western__ cultures foster this kind of thinking
    - __Focus on properties of object or people__, pay less attention to context or situation
- Holistic thinking
    - Values in __Eastern__ cultures foster this kind of thinking
    - Focus on the object or person __AND the surrounding context and relationships between them__
- Generalized cultural difference, but variability within cultures

## Social neuroscience evidence

- Judged length of line inside boxes
- Two conditions
    - Ignore the box around each line (ignore context)
    - Pay attention to the box around each line (attend to context)
- Result
    - Americans: greater brain activation when told to pay attention to context
    - East Asians: greater brain activation when told to ignore context

## Cultural differences in the fundamental attribution error

- Members of individualistic cultures
    - Prefer dispositional(支配) attributions
    - Think like personality psychologist
- Members of collectivistic cultures
    - Prefer situational explanations
    - Think like social psychologists

## Culture and other attributional biases

- Self-serving bias
    - __More prevalent in Western__, individualistic cultures that Eastern collectivist cultures
- Explanations of Olympic Gold Success
- Failure
    - Make attributions to external causes in U.S., but internal causes in China
    - Self-critical attributions hold groups together in some Asian cutures
- Belief in a just world
    - __More prevalent in cultures with extreme differences in wealth__
