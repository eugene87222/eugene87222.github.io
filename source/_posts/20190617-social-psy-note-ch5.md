# The Self: Understanding Ourselves in a Social Context

---

# What is the self-concept, and how does it develop ?

## Self-concept

The __overall set of beliefs__ that people have about their __personal attributes__

## Origins of the self

Rudimentary self-concept 初步的自我概念

- Some primates
- Humans at 18 ~ 24 months

Child's self-concept 小孩的自我概念

- Concrete
- __References to characteristics like age, sex, neighborhood, hobbies__

Maturing self-concept

- __Less emphasis on physical characteristics__

## Cultural influences on the self-concept

- Independent view of the self-concept 獨立自我觀
    - 西方國家
- Interdependent view of the self 相依自我觀
    - 亞洲、非西方國家

## Functions of the self

- 4 main functions
    - Self-knowledge 
    - Self control
    - Impression management
    - Self-esteem

# To what extent do people know themselves through introspection, and what are the consequences of introspection ?

## The way of introspection

- Introspection
    - People do not rely on introspection very often
        - Not alaways pleasant to think about ourselves
        - Reasons for feelings and behavior can be outside conscious awareness

## Focusing on the self: self-awareness theory 自我察覺論

- Sometimes people go far in their attempt to escape the self 逃離自我
    - Focusing on the self can be very aversive
    - Ways to turn off __internal spotlight__ on oneself 內在聚光燈
        - 酗酒
        - 狂吃
        - SM
- Not all means of escaping the self are damaging
    - 信仰
- Self-focus is not always damaging or aversive
    - Example: if you have experienced a major success
    - Can also remind you of your sense of right and wrong

## Judging why we feel the way we do: telling more than we can know

- It can be difficult to know why we feel the way we do
    - 為什麼喜歡你的另一伴
    - 你現在心情如何
- Causal theories 因果論
    - Theories about the __causes of one's own feelings and behaviors__; often we learn such theories from our culture
- Problem
    - Schemas and theories are not always correct

## The consequences of introspecting about reasons

- Reasons-generated attitude change 原因導致的態度改變
- Problem
    - __Focus on things that are easy to put in words__
    - __Ignore feelings harder to explain__
    - __Hard-to-explain feelings are the ones that often matter in the long run__

# In what ways do people come to know themselves by observing their behavior ?

## Self-percpetion theory 自我知覺論

The theory that when our attitudes and feelings are uncertain or ambiguous, we infer these states by __observing our behavior and the situation in which it occurs__

- Infer inner feelings from behavior
    - Only when not sure how we feel
- Judge whether behavior
    - Really reflects how we feel
    - Or the situation that made us act that way

## Intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation 內在動機與外在動機

- Intrinsic motivation
- Extrinsic motivation
- Overjustification effect 過度辯護效應
    - The tendency of people to view their behavior as caused by compelling extrinsic reasons, making them underestimate the extent to which it was caused by intrinsic reasons

## Preserving intrinsic interest

- Task-contingent rewards 以任務為條件的獎賞
- Performance-contingent rewards 以表現為條件的獎賞
- Avoiding over-justification when using rewards
    - Rewards will undermine interest only if interest was initially high
    - The type of rewards makes a difference

## Mindsets and motivation 心態與動機

- Fixed mindset 固定心態
- Growth mindset 成長心態
- Mindset affects motivation
    - __Fixed mindset more likely to give up and do poorly on subsequent tasks after failure__

## Understanding our emotions: the two-factor theory of emotion 情緒二因論

- Infer our emotions by observing our behavior
- We experience emotions in a two-step self-perception process
    - Experience physiological arousal (生理激發)
    - Seek an appropriate explanation for it
- Cover story: injection of "suproxin" test of vision
    - IV 1: __Physiological arousal__
        - Epinephrine informed
            - (shake, heart pound, face flush)
        - Epinephrine ignorant
            - (mild, harmless, no side effects)
        - Placebo
            - (saline, mild, harmless, no side effects)
    - IV 2: __Environment cues (mood of "stooge")__
        - Euphoric / happy (playing games)
        - Angry (insulting questionnaire)
    - DV: participant's mood
- Results
    - Epinephrine informed group
        - Did not become angry when exposed to angry stooge
            - __Had alterante explanation for their arousal__ (the drug)
    - Epinephrine ignorant group
        - Became euphoric
            - Joined stooge in playing games
## Implications of the two-factor theory of emotion

- Implications
   - Emotions are somewhat arbitrary 主觀獨斷
   - __Emotions depend on our explanations for arousal__

## Finding the wrong cause: misattribution of arousal

- To what extent do the results found by Schachter and Singer generalize to everyday life ?
   - Do people form mistaken emotions in the same way as participants in that study did ?
   - In everyday life, one might argue, people usually know why they are aroused
- Misattribution of arousal
- Arousal from on source (e.g., caffeine, exercise, a fright) can enhance the intensity of how the person interprets other feelings

# In what ways do people use others to know themselves ?

Self-concept is shaped by people around us

## Knowing ourselves by comparing ourselves to others

- How do we use others to define ourselves ?
   - Measure our own abilities and attitudes by comparing to other people
- Social comparison theory 社會比較論

- Goal: know the furthest level to which we can aspire
   - Upward social comparison 向上社會比較
- Goal: feel better about yourself
