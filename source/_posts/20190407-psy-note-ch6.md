# Conditioning and Learning

# Some types of learning

- Learning
- Associative learning
    - 2 types of associative learning: classical conditioning / operant conditioning
    - Reinforcement: any event that increases the probability that a response will recur
    - Antecedents: events that precede a response. more important in classical conditioning
    - Consequences: effects that follow a response. more important in operant conditioning
- Cognitive learning

# Classical conditioning

- Discovered by Ivan Pavlov, the Russian physiologist who studied digestion by presenting dogs with meat powder and measuring salivation
- Neutral stimulus 中性刺激: stimulus that does not evoke a response
- Conditioned stimulus 條件刺激: stimulus that evokes a response because it has been repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus
- Unconditioned stimulus 無條件刺激: stimulus innately capable of eliciting a response
- Unconditioned response: innate reflex response elicited by an unconditioned stimulus
- Conditioned response: learned response elicited by a conditioned stimulus
- Unlike Pavlov, many psychologists think that classical conditioning involves cognition because it is related to information that might aid survival
    - Informational view: organisms look for associations among events
    - Expectancy: expectation about how events are interconnected
- principles of classical conditioning
    - Acquisition: training period in conditioning when a response is strengthened
    - Higher-order conditioning 高層次制約: a conditioned stimulus is used to reinforce further learning; the CS is used as though it were a UCS
- Extinction: weakening of a conditioned response through removal of reinforcement
- Spontaneous recovery: reappearance of a learned response following apparent extinction
- Generalization and discrimination
    - Stimulus generalization 刺激類化
    - Stimulus discrimination 刺激區辨
- Classical conditioning in humans
    - Phobia
    - Conditioned emotional response (CER) 制約情緒反應
    - Vicarious classical conditioning 替代古典制約: learning to respond emotionally to a stimulus by observing another’s emotional reactions
- Overcoming phobias
    - Systematic desensitization: decreasing fear or anxiety by exposing phobic people gradually to feared stimuli while they stay calm and relaxed

# Operant conditioning (Instrumental Learning)

- Learning is based on the consequences of responding; we associate responses with their consequences
- Law of effect (Edward Thorndike): the probability of a response is altered by the effect it has, so responses that lead to desired effects are repeated; those that lead to undesired effects are not
- Operant reinforcer: any event that follows a response and increases its likelihood of recurring
- Acquiring an operant response
    - Conditioning chamber (Skinner box): 關動物做實驗
    - Animals actively emit behavior; consequences influence how frequently behavior occurs
    - Response-contingent reinforcement 反應依仗強化: reinforcement given only after a desired response occurs
- timing of reinforcement
    - Operant reinforcement most effective when given immediately after a correct response
    - Response chaining: a linked series of actions that leads to reinforcement
    - Superstitious behaviors: behaviors that are repeated because they appear to produce reinforcement (i.e., the timing is right), even though they are not necessary (動物可能發展出奇怪的儀式化反應；它可能輕敲自己的頭，轉圈子，以後腳站立，或是做一系列當餵食機開啟時，他正在做的行為。這些儀式化的行為，我們把它們歸類為迷信行為，因為動物看起來似乎相信它所做的行為使得食物丸出現，因為在這種情境裡獎賞與動物的行為無關，我們將它稱為非連鎖增強作用)
- Shaping: 海洋公園訓練海狗那樣
- Operant extinction
    - When learned responses are NOT reinforced, they gradually fade away
    - Negative attention seeking: using misbehavior to gain attention
    - 消除不良行為的方法 -> 消弱，讓個體失去增強物，以降低不良行為發生頻率
- Reinforcement contingencies 強化依仗性
    - Reinforcer 強化物
    - Reinforcement 強化 (動作本身): increases probability of that behavior
    - 正強化: behavior is followed by delivery of appetitve stimulus
    - 負強化: behavior is followed by removal of aversive stimulusk
- Punishment
    - Punisher 跟上面一樣概念
    - Punishment -> decreases probability of that behavior
    - 正懲罰: behavior is followed by delivery of aversive stimulus
    - 負懲罰: behavior is followed by removal of appetitive stimulus
    - Downside of punishment
        - Aversive stimulus 嫌惡刺激: 不舒服的 stimulus
        - Escape learning: learning to make a response to end an aversive stimulus
        - Avoidance learning
- Stimulus control
    - Operant stimulus generalization 刺激類化
    - Operant stimulus discrimination 刺激區辨
- Operant reinforcers
    - Primary reinforcer 初級強化物: unlearned and natural; satisfies physiological needs (e.g., food, water, sex)
        - Intracranial stimulation (ICS) 顱內刺激: natural primary reinforcer; involves direct activation of brain’s "pleasure centers"
    - Secondary reinforcer 次級強化物: learned reinforcer (e.g., money, grades, approval, praise); gains reinforcing properties by associating with a primary reinforcer
    - Token reinforcer 代幣強化物: tangible secondary reinforcer
    - Social reinforcer 社會強化物: attention and approval provided by other people
- Reinforcement concepts
    - Schedules of reinforcement
    - Continuous reinforcement
    - Partial reinforcement
        - Fixed ratio schedule 定比強化: a set number of correct responses must be made to obtain a reinforcer
        - Variable ratio schedule 不定比強化: varied number of correct responses must be made to get a reinforcer
        - Fixed interval schedule 定時強化
        - Variable interval schedule 不定時強化
    - Partial reinforcement effect 部分強化效應: responses acquired with partial reinforcement are more resistant to extinction

# Cognitive learning

- Higher-level learning involving thinking, knowing, understanding, and anticipating
- Latent learning 潛伏學習: occurs without obvious reinforcement and is not demonstrated (or is hidden) until reinforcement is provided
- Cognitive map 認知地圖: internal images or other mental representations of an area (maze, city, etc.) that underlie an ability to choose alternate paths to the same goal
- Feedback
- Learning aids
    - Programmed instruction: learning format that presents information in small amounts, gives immediate practice, and provides continuous feedback
    - Computer-assisted instruction (CAI): learning aided by computer-presented information and exercises
    - Serious games: CAI presented in a game format
    - Educational simulations: imaginary situations or "microworlds" that simulate real-world problems
- Discovery learning
    - Rote learning 機械式學習
    - Base on insight & understanding
- Observational learning
    - Occurs by watching and imitating actions of another person or by noting consequences of a person’s actions
    - Model 模範

5. Self-management skills
- Premack principle
    - Any high-frequency response can be used to reinforce a low-frequency response (e.g., no TV watching until you finish your homework)
    - Self-recording: self-management based on keeping records of response frequencies
- How to break bad habits
    - Alternate behavior: try to get the same reinforcement with a new response
    - Break up response chains: scramble the chain of events that leads to an undesired response
    - Reduce cues and antecedents: try to avoid, narrow down, or remove stimuli that elicit the bad habit
    - Use covert sensitization and reward
        - Covert sensitization 隱藏式敏感化: the use of aversive imagery to reduce undesired behavior
        - Covert reinforcement 隱藏式強化: the use of positive imagery to reinforce desired behavior
